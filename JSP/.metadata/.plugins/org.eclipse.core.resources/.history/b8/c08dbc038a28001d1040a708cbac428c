            Hello! I'm Stella Kim. Welcome to my homepage.<br>
            I majored in English and worked as a hotelier in Singapore. <br>
            After I came back to Korea, I was also in the service fields. <br>
            But I don't want to see myself in the same industry in the few years. <br>
            The reason I want to be a fullstack engineer is that <br>
            there is no limits for studying and developing myself! <br>
            Achievement is one of my motivation of my life. <br><br>
            To be a great developer, <br>
            achievement and developing myself constantly <br>
            is the most important thing, I think.
            <br><br>
            For the future junior developer!</h3>
